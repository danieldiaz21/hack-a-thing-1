# Introduction to Android Development

This is me dipping my toes in the world of Android development, aided by the tutorial [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII). I have never explored Android Studio, but have always been interested in app development, hence my decision to explore this new technology. Additionally, this course has targeted and reignited my Java coding muscles and conceptual understanding (it has been 2 years since I coded in Java)

## Architecture

This lacks a formal project structure as this journey is more of a learning experience rather than a project experience. The amount of time I spent learning is not reflected by the contents in this repository. Nonetheless, there are mini challenges introduced in the tutorial which I have included in the form of folders. 

## Setup

I utilized Android Studio and Intellij IDEA.


## Authors
